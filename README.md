My First Android App

This is a very light version of the game Rock, Paper, Scissors pitting the user against the random number generator of their 
Android phone. I am building this from scratch in order to teach myself how to develop and Android App. Subsequent versions 
of this App will contain improvements as I learn to implement them.
